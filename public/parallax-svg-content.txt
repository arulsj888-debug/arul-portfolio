This file contains the SVG markup that needs to be inserted into ParallaxSVGScroll.js

The SVG is too large to include directly in the component file.
Please refer to the original code provided by the user for the complete SVG markup.

The SVG should be placed between the opening <svg> tag and closing </svg> tag in the component.
